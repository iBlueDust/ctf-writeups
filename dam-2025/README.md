DamCTF 2025 is held by the Oregon State University Security Club. It is a jeopardy-style CTF with a variety of challenges, including web, pwn, reverse engineering, and quite a number of miscellaneous challenges, but no forensics ones.

There were relatively few challenges in this CTF, and it lasted 36 hours.

The flag takes the form `dam{...}`.
