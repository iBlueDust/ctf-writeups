# My CTF Writeups

These are writeups for various Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges that I have participated in. My solves are typically implemented with the excellent `pwntools` library, a Swiss Army knife for CTF challenges. 

Credit goes to the authors of the challenges, and I have made every effort to give credit where it is due. If you see any errors or omissions, please let me know. Thank you for all CTF challenge authors for your hard work and creativity.
